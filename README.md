# Multilabel-Toxic-Comment-Detection-and-Classification
Toxic comments refers to hatred online comments classified as disrespectful or abusive towards individual or community. With a boom of internet, lot of users are brought to online social discussion platforms. These platforms are created to exchange ideas, learning new things and have meaningful conversations. But due to toxic comments many users are not able to put their points in online discussions. This degrades quality of discussion. In this paper we will check the toxicity of comment. And if the comment is toxic then classify the comments into different categories to examine the type of toxicity. We will utilize different machine learning and deep learning algorithms on our dataset and select the best algorithms based on our evaluation methodology. Moving forward we seek to attain high performance through our machine learning and deep learning models which will help in limiting the toxicity present on various discussion sites.
